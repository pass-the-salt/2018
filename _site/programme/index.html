<p><strong>Duration: 2h30</strong><br />
<strong>Maximum number of attendees: 25</strong><br />
<br />
<a href="https://www.bro.org/">Bro is an open-source Network Security Monitor (NSM) and analytics platform</a>. Even though it has been around since the mid 90’s, its main user base was primarily universities, research labs and supercomputing centers. In the past few years however, more and more security professionals in the industry turned their attention to this powerful tool, as it runs on commodity hardware, thus providing a low-cost alternative to commercial solutions.</p>

<p>At its core, Bro inspects traffic and creates an extensive set of well-structured, tab-separated log files that record a network’s activity. Nonetheless, Bro is a lot more than just a traditional signature-based IDS. While it supports such standard functionality as well, Bro’s scripting language allows security analysts to perform arbitrary analysis tasks such as extracting files from sessions, detecting malware by interfacing with an external source, detecting brute-forcing, etc. It comes with a large set of pre-built standard libraries, just like Python.</p>

<p>During this two-hour workshop, we will learn about Bro’s capabilities and cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Introduction to Bro</li>
  <li>Bro architecture</li>
  <li>Bro events and logs</li>
  <li>Bro signatures</li>
  <li>Bro scripting</li>
  <li>Bro and ELK</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Requirements for the workshop:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A laptop with at least 8 GB of RAM and more than 30 GB of free disk space</li>
<li>VMWare Workstation or VMWare Player installed</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Duration: 3h</strong><br />
<strong>Maximum number of attendees: 25</strong><br />
<br />
<a href="https://github.com/CIRCL/AIL-framework">AIL</a> is an open source modular framework to analyse potential information leaks from unstructured data sources like pastes from Pastebin or similar services or unstructured data streams. The primary aim of the framework is to gather credentials, emails, creditcard numbers and so on in order to help security experts to detect leaks and then, react accordingly. Moreover, <a href="https://github.com/CIRCL/AIL-framework">AIL</a> framework is flexible and can be extended fairly easily to support other functionalities to mine sensitive information.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/CIRCL/AIL-framework">AIL</a> workshop will show how the framework functions, how to use it, how you can feed the software with your own data and finally how you can contributes to help us improve AIL with new features.</p>

<p><strong>Requirements:</strong> a laptop with 8GB of RAM, 2 cores and VirtualBox installed.

<p><strong>Duration: 2h</strong><br />
<strong>Maximum number of attendees: 25</strong><br />
<br />
Whenever one want to run an investigation over the URLs crawled from her/his organization website, it can get tricky: millions of URLs to follow, hard to keep control on what is going on. This presentation will focus on the open source tool called <a href="https://github.com/stricaud/faup">FAUP for Finally An URL Parser</a> and show how it has been used with large organizations to quickly understand new threats.  Faup helps with the snapshot mechanism to classify URLs to be used for Machine Learning, it gives an automatic way of creating a white list at scale to then only spend the time focusing on the URLs you are not aware of. Faup can be used similarly to Dshield and gather intelligence over URLs and will show how collaboration over something as simple as an URL in conjunction with <a href="http://www.misp-project.org/">MISP</a> can enhance the discovery of unknown threats.

<p>When we need to deeply analyze a binary application (e.g. for malware dissection, vulnerability research, code optimization), static code analysis is what we use most of the time. However, static analysis of machine-code is usually not an easy task. It is actually a tough one in case of malware analysis. Luckily, existing machine-code decompilers help with this task significantly. On the other hand, the most well-known decompilers are either proprietary, cannot be easily modified for a given task, or both.</p>

<p>In this talk, we would like to depict our machine-code decompiler called <a href="https://retdec.com/">RetDec</a> (Retargetable Decompiler) that we are developing in Avast since 2011 and which we have open-sourced a few months ago under the MIT license. Its primary goal is, of course, decompilation of binary (malicious) applications, but its components can also be used for other tasks, such as disassembly, extraction of basic blocks, or initial assessment of malware samples.

<p>The Spectre attack has had massive coverage, and I assume (nearly) everybody at Pass The Salt will have heard of it. This talk is not yet another explanation of Spectre, nor generic advice of what to do. Rather, this talk is oriented on implementation issues and answering 2 simple questions (which haven’t been addressed yet to my knowledge): 1. Is your Android smartphone vulnerable to Spectre or not? ARM has published a security advisory with a list of vulnerable processors. We’ll see that the answer isn’t as simple as checking the list. . . 2. How can we detect malware using Spectre, and are there any? The media have been quiet about that. Working for an AV company, that’s perhaps something I can contribute to.

<p><a href="https://rada.re/r/">Radare2</a> is a free and open-source reverse engineering framework, which is becoming more and more popular. One of its main criticisms is that it is only usable within a terminal (CLI), and that the commands are not intuitive, making the learning curve steep. The <a href="https://github.com/radareorg/cutter">Cutter project</a> was created to provide an easy-to-use, but still powerful, interface to radare2 for new users. This is done with a native graphical user interface made in Qt and C++.</p>

<p>The goal of the talk is to present radare2 history, along with the common complaints from users, and how we try to overcome those with Cutter. I’ll be presenting the features that are already implemented, the way we allow our users to script the interface, and obviously the missing features that we will implement in a near future.</p>

<p>While Cutter is still under heavy development, it’s becoming more and more user-friendly and easy to use. It is becoming a great alternative to other reverse engineering tools.

<p>BPF (for Berkeley Packet Filter) was made public in 1993 by Steven McCanne and Van Jacobson in a paper called “The BSD packet filter: a new architecture for user-level packet capture”. It became a de facto standard for network packet filtering. It was ported to Linux under the name Linux Socket Filtering (LSF). BPF is an in kernel, efficient (no packets copies from kernel space to user space) but mainly, unified network packet filtering interface. In practice, it is a stack based virtual machine, statically verified by the kernel before running: no loops are permitted, memory accesses are bound checked, and a program cannot be longer than 4096 instructions.  Since then the language was extended making it more suitable for performance, especially because of the JIT capability.</p>

<p>BPF programs are widely known for packet filtering in libpcap (the underlying capture library used by tcpdump and wireshark), but one can also use them for performance analysis (perf uses BPF programs), but also for security (seccomp uses BPF as well).</p>

<p>In this talk, we focus on networking. We will go in depth into BPF bytecode, the available toolchains and API and follow the path of packets from the NIC to a user space application and see how eBPF can be leveraged to perform traffic filtering: from socket filtering API, to tc qdisc filtering, to finally (hopefully) explore XDP capabilities.

<p>When you are facing a security incident, your investigations will depend on the data that you can analyze. If logs are often the first source of evidence, sometimes, it could be interesting to have access to a full packet capture to “dive deeper” in the traffic generated from/to the compromised network or host. Full packet capture (FPC) is like your insurance, you implement it and you never know if you’ll have to use it… Until something weird happened!  In my presentation, I’ll present a simple way to implement FPC for small organizations and based on open source solutions (Moloch, Docker) and how to interconnect them.  This talk is an extension of my SANS ISC diary (The easy way to analyze huge amounts of PCAP data) with more practical details.

<p>We have to admit to ourselves: we do not really like to turn on automatic updates. We do not like relinquishing control. Even if we do not really know what the announced update contains, we like to have one look at it before we hit the “update” button.</p>

<p>Right?</p>

<p>Often, still, we do not even have an automated update option available - like on our phones. And we are nagged every other month or so that an update is available, that we should install it and if we please can hit the “ok” button now to start it.</p>

<p>My mother usually calls me when her phone asks her to update. “Should I?” she asks. And I always say “Yes!” And she keeps on calling me.</p>

<p>Well, that’s what mothers do anyway. But you get the point.</p>

<p>This is technical nonsense. It’s all part of the Legal Blame Game: “Make sure, when things go wrong, we have an excuse.” But from a technical and security point of view, updates need to happen without user intervention, for everyone.</p>

<p>For our security infrastructure, we try to avoid this and jump from “no updates” to full automation. Because expired certificates are just too embarrassing for everyone.</p>

<p>Oh, and we can make it free at the same time - because automation.</p>

<ul>
  <li>the flawed rationale for the JOSE working group</li>
  <li>why JSON is a poor wire format for cryptographic objects</li>
  <li>cryptography issues in the JOSE specifications</li>
  <li>ambiguities and interoperability problems in the specifications</li>

<p>Ever wanted to do forensics and feel good about it? This talk will introduce you to a suite of open-source tools for all things digital forensics and incident response. You will see how Greendale (a fictitious but very famous university) used this set of tools to articulate an effective response to a pretty severe incident last summer—all on a state-financed university budget! We will cover collection of forensic evidence with <a href="http://www.grr-response.com">GRR</a>, processing with <a href="http://log2timeline.net">Plaso</a>, and analysis with <a href="http://timesketch.org/">Timesketch</a>; how these tools can be articulated using <a href="https://github.com/log2timeline/dftimewolf">dftimewolf</a>, how to remotely image disks and have the processing done in the Cloud.

<p>In this talk we explain the constraints and choices that led to the design of <a href="https://landlock.io">Landlock</a>, a new Linux Security Module (LSM) proposal designed to let unprivileged users enforce their own security policy. Landlock has multiple new properties that can complete those of the current major LSMs (e.g. SELinux). Leveraging the eBPF engine, Landlock can apply multiple access controls and make them evolve over time, enabling developers to manage security policy per application instead of dealing with access-control rules defined for the whole system. We answer some questions such as:  What are the constraints and good practices to properly extend the Linux kernel? How Landlock uses eBPF with the LSM framework? What are the required restrictions to express a security policy, with a bytecode like eBPF, in a safe way? We also show a new demo highlighting the dynamic aspect of Landlock.</p>

<p>This talk is intended to be a deep dive into some internals of <a href="https://landlock.io">Landlock</a>. For a more general introduction to Landlock, you can get a look at https://landlock.io (FOSDEM 2018).

<p>Performance is important in many programs: web servers, network applications, intrusion detection systems, etc. In these programs, C is a usual choice as the programming language: it is close to the hardware, and very fast. However, it is very hard to make the program secure, and this results in many vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>This talk is about why and how use rust to achieve both performance and security by creating a “safe zone” in a C program. We first look at the good code patterns to produce efficient code, and the limits of this approach. We then go through the optimization of the code to gain more performance, and check that doing so we do not remove any important check.</p>

<p>We can use Kerberos as an example, since it is based on ASN.1/DER, which is both difficult to manipulate, and very error-prone: all objects are Type-Length-Value (TLV), so a C parser has to manipulate recursive objects with pointers and lengths everywhere. DER parsers are regular clients for CVEs.</p>

<p>Keywords: performance, security, rust, assembly</p>

<p>Note: we take the parsers in Suricata as an example of such code. However, this talk is not related to Suricata, but more about the source code, the compiler and the produced code.

<p>After working on IoT security testing for a few years, we realized that there is a lot of time spent on learning and setting up different tools including hardware, radio and software. As the IoT technology is new there is no standard software to test most of the components and the tools available are either not mature yet or do only specific job. With this problem at hand we envisioned a software that would allow developers and researchers to automate most of the IoT security testing steps. We began our journey with writing a flexible and extendable framework that would help the community and us in writing quick IoT test cases and exploits. The objectives of the framework are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Easy of use</li>
  <li>Extendable</li>
  <li>Support for hardware, radio and IoT protocol analysis</li>
</ol>

<p>We released the beta version (in ruby) of <a href="https://bitbucket.org/aseemjakhar/expliot_framework">Expl-iot</a> in 2017. Once we started implementing hardware and radio functionality, we realized that ruby does not have much support for hardware and radio analysis which led us to deprecate it and re-write it in python to support more functionality. We are currently working on the python3 version and will release it in a month or two. The new beta release is envisioned to have support for UART(serial), ZigBee, BLE, MQTT, CoAP (next version will have support for JTAG, I2C and SPI) and few miscellaneous  test cases. This talk would give attendees a first-hand view of the functionality, how to use it and how to write plugins to extend the framework.

<p>A year ago, I embarked on the funky journey to gain insights into IoT security. I am particularly interested in medical devices, that is an item that’s connected to the Internet AND can gather some sort of health data.</p>

<p>I started off with connected sex toys—it’s fun to tear them down, then tell others about it. Beyond the fun, though, is the actual understanding of what is at stake. And, in all honesty, your fridge, your insulin pump and your pacemaker all share the same challenges: they need improved security so that we are not at risk.</p>

<p>Since the first dildo I investigated, my analysis capabilities have evolved. This talk will address the diverse range of challenges I have had: obtaining the objects (the least complex one… but not the cheapest option, still!), producing reproducible data, collecting meaningful logs, having the companies building the IoT fix their flaws, etc. Thankfully, I will also discuss the solutions I identified, all of which involve FLOSS and (in part) open hardware.

<p>The concept of “hacking harnesses” was introduced by <a href="https://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2007kl/materials/D1T1%20-%20The%20Grugq%20-%20Meta%20Antiforensics%20-%20The%20HASH%20Hacking%20Harness.pdf">thegrugq at HITB Kuala Lumpur 2007 (pdf)</a>. Ever since, the subject has received virtually no attention and no such tool has been released publicly. Worse, the code that had been made available at the time is no longer online and was lost by its author. The goal of harnesses is to provide a hacking environment where security professionals can focus on red teaming activities without having to fight against their terminal to perform simple actions (such as uploading or downloading files, and executing remote commands in memory). <a href="https://github.com/JusticeRage/freedomfighting">FFM</a> is a Python framework which was developed to fill this void.

<p>What is one of the cornerstones of the Internet? Right! Being able to access all kinds of information, without censorship. In some countries this is no longer possible, and this is why technologies such as <a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> and <a href="https://shadowsocks.org">Shadowsocks</a> are needed.</p>

<p>While the main feature of Tor is the onion routing and the aim of being cryptographically secure, it can easily be blocked by a firewall.</p>

<p><a href="https://shadowsocks.org">Shadowsocks</a> simply tries to provide an undetectable tunnel to a non-censored part of the Internet.</p>

<p>Shadowsocks provides a Socks5proxy locally, into which all traffic is routed. It encrypts traffic with a configurable symmetric algorithm and the messages have (pseudo) random lengths. The absence of any visible protocol information makes them appear totally random. The goal is stealth through restricted infrastructures.</p>

<p>Naturally, users of such tools may be exposed to increased risks. Therefore the tools aim to be undetectable by deep packet inspection firewalls. For security and privacy they have to encrypt the traffic, use random padding, ensure integrity, and should imitate other protocols so as to look like normal encrypted traffic, e.g. such as that from an encrypted website. The server should be authenticated to ensure that the user does not communicate with a malicious endpoint.</p>

<p>We had a look at Shadowsocks to see how it handles this task, and noticed some interesting things.</p>

<p>This talk shows the results of our efforts to analyse ShadowSocks and identifying real vulnerabilities. There were attempts about detecting shadowsocks.
We show how to brute force it, manipulate its log files. In addition, we will show several local as well as remote command execution vulnerabilities affecting shadowsocks and its tools.
