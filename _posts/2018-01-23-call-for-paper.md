## Travel Costs
Pass the SALT is a community and volunteers handled, free access event with quite a low budget.

So we try to support first the speakers with low resources such as students or coming from developing countries. We only support flight/train costs, not accommodation.

We ask speakers companies (if any) for taking in charge flight and accommodations costs as much as possible.

And, of course, we try to do our best for taking in charge most speakers that ask for.
