You can look at this [list of previous years speakers](https://2018.pass-the-salt.org/achievements/#speakers) :-)
You are (too) shy ? You do not recognize yourself into these descriptions ?
PLEASE, GO ON.
Just submit and we will exchange with you in a respectful and warm manner :-) 
Here is how he summarizes his coming this year:

## (Hot) Topics ?
We definitively want to have **submissions from different Security fields**. We want to facilitate interactions between different Security and Free Software communities.
You can see an on-going **list of previous achievements** there : [link](https://2018.pass-the-salt.org/achievements/#results)
This year, we would really like to cover :
* privacy free software and issues,
* offensive free software and usages
* and hacking tools/software.
All usual Security topics are of course welcome : DFIR, Network, Secure Coding etc.
And, obviously, if you have a brilliant and/or “strange” idea, just SUBMIT !

**Single requirement:** speaking about (Free Software OR Open Standard) AND Security :-) 

## The Format, the Language and the Timeline
You can propose:
* a long talk (40min - questions/answers included),
* a short talk (20min - questions/answers included),
* or a workshop.

Language : **all the talks will be given in English** in order to share the conference with non French speaking speakers in the more confortable manner.

The different dates are :
* **Submission deadline: March 31st, 2018 at 23:59**
* Speakers notification: April 15th, 2018
* Program publication : at the beginning of May, 2018

## Submit: HOW-TO
Submit in 3 actions :
* Go to [https://2018.pass-the-salt.org/cfp/](https://2018.pass-the-salt.org/cfp/) and create an account by following the "Create an account" link at the bottom of the page ,
* Click on the "New Submission" link after the completion of the account creation in order to create a new talk/workshop proposal ,
* Complete the form. The submission can stay in draft mode as long as you want, while the CFP deadlines are not reached.
    
**Important:** when you are ready to submit your proposal to review, check the option "Ready to review" and save the proposal.

## Travel Costs
Pass the SALT is a community and volunteers handled, free access event with quite a low budget.

So we try to support first the speakers with low resources such as students or coming from developing countries. We only support flight/train costs, not accommodation.

We ask speakers companies (if any) for taking in charge flight and accommodations costs as much as possible.

And, of course, we try to do our best for taking in charge most speakers that ask for.
