<h2 id="travel-costs">Travel Costs</h2>
<p>Pass the SALT is a community and volunteers handled, free access event with quite a low budget.</p>

<p>So we try to support first the speakers with low resources such as students or coming from developing countries. We only support flight/train costs, not accommodation.</p>

<p>We ask speakers companies (if any) for taking in charge flight and accommodations costs as much as possible.</p>

<p>And, of course, we try to do our best for taking in charge most speakers that ask for.</p>
