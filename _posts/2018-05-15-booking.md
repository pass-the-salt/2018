The Pass the SALT (Security And Libre Talks) is a **free conference** (as in free beer) **but limited room capacity** (200 seats, speakers and org team included) implies that we set up a booking interface.

The **registration is opened** : [https://2018.pass-the-salt.org/tickets/e/1](https://2018.pass-the-salt.org/tickets/e/1)

Note: after registration of the speakers and the organization team, it remains 151 seats to be booked. Go ahead!
