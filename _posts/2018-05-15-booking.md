<i><br>You can try to enter with this kind of ticket but ;-) ... <br>(thanks @acervoise)</i>

**UPDATE:** the event is currently **SOLD OUT**. Thanks for the trust!

The Pass the SALT (Security And Libre Talks) is a **free conference** (as in free beer) **but limited room capacity** (200 seats, speakers and org team included) implies that we set up a booking interface.

The **registration is open Wednesday 16 May at 10:00am CET** : [https://2018.pass-the-salt.org/tickets/e/1](https://2018.pass-the-salt.org/tickets/e/1)

In case you won't be able to make it to the event, *please* be fair and inform us quickly so your seat can be made available for someone else!

Note: after registration of the speakers and the organization team, 151 seats are left to be booked. Go ahead!
