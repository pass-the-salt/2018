# Code of Conduct 

---

The 2018 Pass the SALT is an event where we want everybody feel safe and comfortable and can come to without any worry.

That's why we ask everyone to follow these rules :

* <b>Be excellent and inclusive to everyone :</b> sexism, racism, homophobia and all other kinds of exclusions and agressions are forbidden whatever their form (written, spoken, online, IRL etc). Such an attitude may expose you up to the immediate exclusion of the event.  

* <b>In case of problem, feel free to reach us (Pass the SALT crew members wear specific t-shirts).</b> We are going to try to speak together in order to solve the problem.  

* If somebody reports you <b>a blessing comment or action coming from you</b>, listen, exchange. If it is impossible, come to us for a mediation.     

Thank to everybody :)
