# Pass the SALT is officially launched!

---

### Why?
After many years curating the RMLL Security Track ([last year edition program](https://prog2017.rmll.info/spip.php?page=rmll_progall&lang=en&t=2)), we (Mathieu Blanc, Christophe Brocas, Philippe Teuwen and joining this year, Cedric Foll) have decided to jump and create an autonomous event dedicated to Free Software and Security.

We really want to **thank all the people met during all these years of RMLL organization** with a particular focus for tracks chairwomen and chairmen : we achieved plenty of good things, and when we have failed, we failed and managed to recover **all together**. Thanks for that !

We just aspire to have a little more permanence, serenity and autonomy. And it took the form of a new conference ;-)

### What?
We want to set up a moment in the year where people coming from different Security communities and Free Software (Incident Response, reverse, crypto, development, OS and network but also hacktivists, privacy oriented developers) can exchange and act together **with a focus on cross-pollination of ideas** :)

More about this and **previous years results** [there](/achievements/#results).

### Next?
Please, be kind to push the information everywhere you can and submit to the coming Call for Papers :-)

Hope (really) to hear you soon !
Mathieu, Christophe, CÃ©dric and Philippe
