## Post-event feedback and lessons!

---

The event is now over since more than a month. The slides are [available](https://2018.pass-the-salt.org/) and videos are [online](https://passthesalt.ubicast.tv/channels/#2018). We really hope you have enjoyed it, locally or even remotely (thanks Ubicast for the livestream!) :-)

To be able to improve the event, the first step was obviously to ask for feedback. So we **sent a survey form to the attendees**. 

We had **98 answers** which means that **57% of the attendees answered**, thanks for that!

# Attendees participation

* **215 registered attendees** (we were sold out) 
* **170 attendees who actually came**. Which means we got 21% of "no show". 
* **Most of them assisted to the 3 days**.

Explanation: as a free (as in free beer) event, we have no way to push people who registered to come. We asked people to inform us if they were unable to come. About 10 people did it.

2019 TODO: 
* No obvious solution has come up for the moment. 
* In the survey, some of you have suggested the following ideas: setting up 3 tickets, one per day, and do some overbooking. 
* We're still thinking about it :)

# Attendees origin

As an English spoken only conference, we were interested to know if we had succeeded in motivating people from outside France to come.

We managed to have **20% of attendees coming from other European countries** and even **3% coming from further away**.

Feedback:
* We had warm feedback from non-French speakers and attendees about our intention to provide a comfortable experience for them (speakers or not). 
* Some other people asked us to provide a way to expand the exchanges in order to "break" the French conversations that naturally came up during the pauses due to the 75% of French attendees.

2019 TODO:
* Ask attendees native language in the registration form to know more precisely the diversity in our public and being able to tailor the experience more precisely.
* Find some ways to facilitate exchanges during pauses: flags on the badge in order to identify the different languages by people in front of you?

# Conference: on the practical side

Let's look at **what people disliked** during the event:

<img src="/img/survey/dislike.png" height="50%" width="50%">

* Even more than on this chart, the comments section of the survey show that numerous attendees complained about the **lack of air conditioning** in the main room. We fully agree. We had to face a warm month of July in Lille, unfortunately.
* Some had reported **not being able to find a fast and easy way to eat**. We surely haven't repeated enough where all restaurants and fastfood were (10min walk at max). 
* Then, still in the comments section, some asked for **better, richer pauses and social event**. Well ... we will try to improve them. But it is already the largest part of our budget and it will never be the top priorities of our free entrance conference.
* The rump session was not fluid enough, too much time switching between speakers

Our priorities are in this order: 
* reimbursement of the transport costs for speakers that need it
* lanyards, badges, stickers
* pauses
* speakers dinner
* social event

And, finally, a feedback from the org team itself: find a way to be less required at the reception desk all day long and be able to follow more talks ;-)

**On the positive part** :

On the practical/general side, people liked the free entrance (a half) and the social event (a third).

From the comments :
* A great team of volunteers (Antoine Cervoise has to be added to this shot): thank for that!
* A lot of compliments about the wooden badges by @doegox (How-to during the rump session - [slides](https://2018.pass-the-salt.org/files/talks/rump09-story-behind-our-goodies.pdf)/[video](https://passthesalt.ubicast.tv/videos/rump-story-behind-our-goodies/))

2019 TODO:
* investigate possibilities to cool down the room
* improve rump session fluidity, try to get a maximum of slides on the same machine
* improve the design of the social event coins in order to better prevent their loss
* improve the pauses content
* improve networking experience for non-French speaking people
* before each day mid-day break, explain how to find the restaurants location
* set up reception desk opening (and closing!) hours
* have a way to prevent badge flipping / allow to add some information on them (personal information like project, twitter handle, company, languages spoken etc)

# Conference, on the content side

As seen above, on the **positive side**, we heard people liked :
* a conference **dedicated to Security AND to Free Software** (>90%)
* the talk diversity (70%) and content (58%). A lot of people reported in the comment section that they really liked to get **several dedicated sessions** providing **balance between defensive and offensive topics**.
* the talks formats: **not too long** and having **rumps session**.

**Details about which sessions were appreciated:**

**Improvements**:
* **Less talks** in order to be able to propose **a less dense schedule** and have more time for chitchat.
* **Stricter talks evaluation** during CFP
* **Start later** would also ease the access to the venue which is 30min away from the center of Lille
* **Add several other talk formats** in order to avoid talks tunnel: roundtable, projects/tools demos etc.


Eventually, the screen ratio: we have been told by IT staff that the video projector could only handle the 4:3 ratio and we didn't challenge this assertion correctly. 16:9 was perfect but we pushed the 4:3 recommendation to the speakers :-(.
