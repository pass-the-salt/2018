# After the event, coming back with some feedback and lessons!

---

The event is now over since more than a month. The slides are [available](https://2018.pass-the-salt.org/) and videos are [online](https://passthesalt.ubicast.tv/channels/#2018). We really hope you have enjoyed it, locally or even remotely (thanks Ubicast for the livestream!) :-)

But to be able to improve the event in a way you want to, the first step was obviously to ask for your feedback. So we **sent a survey form to the attendees**. 

We had **98 answers** which means that **57% of attendees answered**, thanks for that!

## 1. The attendees

* **215 registered attendees** (sold out event) 
* **170 attendees who effectiviley came**. It represents 21% of "no show". 
* **Most of you stay the 3 days long** according to the survey.

Explanation: as a free (as in free beer) event, we have no way to push people who have registered to come. We asked people to send us an alert if they were unable to come. Some have done it (~10 people).

2019 TODO: 
* no evident solution has come up for the moment. 
* In the survey, some of you have suggested the following ideas: setting up 3 tickets, one per day, and do some overbooking. 
* the reflection is still ongoing :)

**From where**

As an English spoken only conference, we were interested to know if we had succeeded in motivating people from outside France to come.

We finally managed to have **20% attendees coming from other european countries** and even **3% coming from anoter country in the world**.

Feedback:
* We had warm feedback from non FR speakers and attendees about our intention to provide a comfortable experience for non FR speaking people (speakers or not). 
* Some other people asked us to provide a way to expand the exchanges in order to "break" the french conversations that naturally came up during the pauses due to the 75% of french attendees.

2019 TODO:
* asking for native language spoken in the registering form in order to know more precisely our public and being able to tailor the experience more precisely.
* find some ways to ease non FR exchanges during pauses: flags on the badge in order to identify the different languages by people in front of you?

## 2. The conference: on the practical side

Let's look at **what you dislike** during the event:

* Even more than on this chart, it is in the comments section of the survey where numerous attendees complained about the **lack of air conditionning** in the main room. We agree. We had to face a warm month of July in Lille, unfortunately.
* Some of you seem **not being able to find a fast and easy way to eat**. We surely haven't repeat enough where all restaurants and fastfood were (10min walk at max). 
* Then, always in the comments section, several of you asked for **better, richer pauses and social event**. Well ... we will try to improve them. But it will never be the top priorities of our free entrance conference. 

We use our money in that order: 
* reimbursement of the transport costs for speakers that need it
* lanyards, badges, stickers
* pauses
* speakers dinner
* social event

And, finally, a feedback from the org team itself: find a way to not to stick on the receiption desk all along the day. That way, we would be able to follow more than 1 or 2 full talks during the entire conference ;-)

**On the positive part** :

On the practical/general side (content side below), you like the free entrance (half of you), the social event (third of you).

And also in the comment section :
* A great team of volunteers (Antoine Cervoise has to be added to this shot): thank for that!
* A lot of compliments about the wood badges by @doegox (How-to during the rump session - [slides](https://2018.pass-the-salt.org/files/talks/rump09-story-behind-our-goodies.pdf)/[video](https://passthesalt.ubicast.tv/videos/rump-story-behind-our-goodies/))

2019 TODO:
* improve the design of the social event coins in order to better prevent their loss
* improve the pauses content
* improve networking experience for non FR native people
* before each day mid-day break, explain how to find the restaurants location
* setting up receiption desk openning (and closing!) periods
* having a way to prevent badge revert / adding some informations on them (personal informations like project, twitter handle, company, languages spoken etc)

## 2. The conference, on the content side

As seen before, on the **positive side**, we can check :
* a conference **dedicated to Security AND to Free Software** (>90%)
* the talk diversity (70%) and content (58%). A lot of people report in the comment section that they really like the **several sessions** providing **balance between defensive and offensive topics**.
* having **not too long talks format** and **rumps session**.

**Details about which sessions you like:**

<img src="/img/survey/sessions.png" height="50%" width="50%">

**Improvements** required according to you:
* **less talks** in order to be able to **a less full/intense schedule**
* **Stricter talks evaluation during CFP**
* **starting later** would also ease the access to the venue which is 30min away from the center of Lille
* **Adding several other talk formats** in order to avoid talks tunnel: roundtable, projects/tools demos etc.


Last, the screen ratio: we have been told by IT staff that the video projector can only handle the 4:3 ratio and we don't challenge it correctly. 16:9 was perfect but we push the 4:3 recommandation to the speakers :-(.
